  Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional inner product space over $\R$ and let $E$ be a normed space over $\C$. Suppose that $f : V \to C$ is in $L^1(V,E)\cap L^2(V,E)$ and let $\widehat{f}$ be the Fourier transform of $f$. Then $\widehat{f}\in L^2(V,E)$ and
  \[\|\widehat{f}\|_{L^2} = \|f\|_{L^2}.\]

  \leanok % the *statement* of the lemma is formalized
  Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional inner product space over $\R$ and let $E$ be a normed space over $\C$. The Fourier transform induces a continuous linear map $L^2(V,E) \to L^2(V,E)$.
